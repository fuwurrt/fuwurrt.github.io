                The word "spasmodic" is used to describe something that occurs or is done in brief, irregular bursts. (weirdly explained the charts but okay just watch it and you will understand).</p>

            <p>Phigros has several collab "chapters" with several other rhythm games and/or artists. Below will be 3 of the most popular collabs (in my opinion) of the game.</p>
            <ul>BassAreUs</ul>
            <p id="yap">A collaboration with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cametek.CamelliaOfficial">かめりあ (Camellia)</a>, one of the biggest composers every in the rhythm gaming community, this collab has brought surprises to players.
                One of the most played songs is +ERABY+E CONNEC+10N, included in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kT6v_aOqqVIYt6EZhm5UGVY0AGULPDNxw">Tera I/O</a> album of Camellia.</p>

            <p id="yap">SEGA's famous rhythm arcade game, despite only having 3 songs included, the picks were rather interesting.<br>
                 One of them is TECHNOPOLIS 2085, made by PRASTIK DANCEFLOOR. It has raised quite interesting arguments of the songs being "wobbly", yet it still is unique.</p>

            With the introduction of 5 songs, You are the Miserable by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tpazolite_jp">t+pazolite</a> grabs the majority's attention, as the composer is well-known in several games.</p>

            <li><h2>April Fools</h2></li>
            <p>Phigros is sometimes also known for the gimmicks that they have done for this unannouced "holiday". Here are a look through 3 years of post-Legacy (version 3.0.0 onwards) April Fools.</p>
            <ul>2022 April Fools</ul>
            <p id="yap">There are two songs included, the first one - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IW8hUZtDplA?si=MBWgdWwuynkLnT8I">Sigma (Haocore Mix) ~ 105秒の伝説</a> - is the gateway song,
                where you need to achieve a score between 600.000-699.999 to unlock the main focal point of this year: <span id="perfect">Sigma (Haocore Mix) ~ Regrets of the Yellow Tulip ~</span>. 
            Consisted of 4000 notes, this was the one that included the highest note count ever in the game. In addition, the chart did not have the presence of the judgement line. </p>

            </div>
            <ul>2023 April Fools</ul>
            <p id="yap">The gateway song this time being <a href="https://youtu.be/Cq40p1QC-30?si=EUQkgm7Jt00b7CM5">雪降り、メリクリ</a>, just a normal song in the Single collection of the game.
                Yet, the gimmick starts when the difficulty is shown as "26°C" on the bottom right. When clicked, an AC remote will appear.
                Here, there are two things you can do:<br>
                First, if you try to increase the temperature, the screen will become red and wobbly(mimicking a hot weather environment), and when 40°C is reached, you will be brought back to the selection screen.<br>
                But if you decrease it, at 0°C, it will change to the gimmick song of this year: <span id="perfect">今年も「雪降り、メリクリ」目指して頑張ります！！</span><br>
                At first, it appears to be a LV. 12 song, pretty simple for the majority, but when you reach 240 notes, it changes to a ? (it means good luck with that)
